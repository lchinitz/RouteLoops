# RouteLoops
This is working RouteLoops code.
It works using APIs from various mapping services.
Code for various services is stored in separate directories.

To run the code:
(1) You will need nodejs running on your machine.
(2) You will need an API key for whatever mapping service you choose to use.
(3) Start by running the server code.  For example, "node serverCode.js" in the GoogleVersion directory.
(4) This should launch a server running at port 8080.
(5) Use a browser and navigate to localhost:8080.  You should see the RouteLoops user interface.
