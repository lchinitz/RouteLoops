      <div style="height: 100%; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; padding: 6px 15px; text-align: left;">
        <p>RouteLoops.com has been creating closed-loop routes for many years now, and to all of our users over that time we say, thank you.</p>
        <p>The primary RouteLoops.com site uses Google Maps, and the Google Maps APIs, to generate and present routes. Over time, that has become more and more expensive,
	  and since we provide the RouteLoops service for free to our users, we are no longer able to offer the Google-Maps-based interface.</p>
	<p>There are other versions of RouteLoops built on top of other mapping services (Open Street Maps, and MapBox), and we have chosen to continue offering the free RouteLoops.com
	  service using one of those versions.</p>
	<h2>Other options to get RouteLoops</h2>
	<p>RouteLoops.com has been fortunate, over the years, to work with several companies interested in offering closed-loop routing for outdoor activities.  Among the best of these
	  has been <a href="https://www.garmin.com" target="_blank">Garmin</a>, which has built RouteLoops into
	  their <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/wearable-maps/round-trip/" target="_blank">Round-Trip
	    Routing</a> offering.  Many Garmin devices support Round Trip Routing, and with an account you can build Round-Trip Routes inside
	  of <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/course/create" target="_blank"> Garmin Connect</a>.</p>
	  
	<h2>Announcing the open-sourcing of the RouteLoops code</h2>
	<p>Although we have chosen not to continue providing the Google Maps version of RouteLoops, with the expiration of the RouteLoops patent
	  (<a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/patents/html/7162363?source=USPAT&requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIwYWQ2ZjAwOS05NWE2LTQwMmQtOGJmZC01MmU1OTk0M2EyMWMiLCJ2ZXIiOiJhNTJlMzQxMy1lMTdkLTQ3Y2EtYjRlZi0wOGFjNzA1YWFkNDQiLCJleHAiOjB9" target="_blank">7,162,363</a>)
	  we have decided to put the RouteLoops.com code into the public domain.  If someone would like to create a new site using either the concept, or the code, you are welcome to do that.
	  If you do, please inform the wider RouteLoops community.</p>
	<p>Example, but highly functional, RouteLoops code is now available on <a href="https://github.com/lchinitz/RouteLoops" target="_blank">github</a>.  There are three versions of the code:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Google Maps version</li>
	    <li>Open Street Maps version using Leaflet</li>
	    <li>MapBox version</li>
	  </ol>
