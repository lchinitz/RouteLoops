	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">End of availability of the Google Maps based version </h3>
        The primary RouteLoops.com site uses Google Maps, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps">Google Maps APIs</a>, to generate and present routes.
	  As that has become more and more expensive, and since we provide the RouteLoops service for free, we have decided to no longer offer the Google-Maps-based interface.
	
	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Continued support of the MapBox based version </h3>
	There are other versions of RouteLoops built on top of other mapping services (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">Open Street Maps</a> and
	  <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/"  target="_blank">MapBox</a>), and we have chosen to continue offering the free RouteLoops service built on MapBox.
	
	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Other options to get RouteLoops</h3>
	RouteLoops has been fortunate, over the years, to work with several companies interested in offering closed-loop routing for outdoor activities.  Among the best of these
	  has been <a href="https://www.garmin.com" target="_blank">Garmin</a>, which has built RouteLoops into
	  their <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/wearable-maps/round-trip/" target="_blank">Round-Trip
	    Routing</a> offering.  Many Garmin devices support Round Trip Routing, and with an account you can build Round-Trip Routes inside
	  of <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/" target="_blank"> Garmin Connect</a>.
	  
	<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Announcing the availability of the RouteLoops code</h2>
	Although we have chosen not to continue providing the Google Maps version of RouteLoops, with the expiration of the RouteLoops patent
	  (<a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1d/1b/83/84cd1fae851bbe/US7162363.pdf" target="_blank">7,162,363</a>)
	  we have decided to put the RouteLoops code into the public domain.<br/>
	Working examples of the RouteLoops code are now available on <a href="https://github.com/lchinitz/RouteLoops" target="_blank">github</a>.  There are three versions of the code:
	  <ol  style="margin-top: 0; padding-top:0;margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom:0;">
	    <li>Google Maps version</li>
	    <li>Open Street Maps version using Leaflet</li>
	    <li>MapBox version</li>
	  </ol>
	  So if you really want the version running on Google Maps, feel free to download the code and run it locally.
	  And if anyone would like to create a new site using either the concept, or the code, you are welcome to do that.
	  If you do, please inform the wider RouteLoops community.
